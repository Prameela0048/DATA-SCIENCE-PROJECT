# DATA-SCIENCE-PROJECT
Health insurance plays a crucial role in providing financial security to individuals and families during times of medical emergencies. Accurately predicting health insurance costs can aid insurance providers in offering competitive premiums to policyholders while maintaining sustainable business practices.
->This model leverages a diverse dataset containing historical health insurance claims, demographic information, lifestyle factors, and medical records of policyholders.
->I preprocess and feature engineer the data to extract relevant patterns and eliminate noise, ensuring the model's robustness.
-> Key features such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, pre-existing conditions, and region are incorporated into the prediction process.
-> I used the RandomForestRegressor technique to predict the health insurance cost.
